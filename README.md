# t-flipflop
T stands for ("toggle") flip-flop to avoid an intermediate state in SR flip-flop. We should provide only one input to the flip-flop called Trigger input Toggle input to avoid an intermediate state occurrence.  Then the flip - flop acts as a Toggle switch. The next output state is changed with the complement of the present state output.
